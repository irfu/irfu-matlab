RPW/BIAS Calibration pipeline
=============================
BIAS(IRFU) delivers:
* Calibration files for E field DC/LF (up to 10kHZ)
* s/w L1 > L2 satellite potential
* s/w L1 > L2 E field time series
* s/w L1 > L2 probe sweeps

Alternatively, instead of the software we might provide the calibrated data,
but it feels that it is better to deliver the software. Then the data
production will be performed elsewhere, and our role will be to provide
updated calibration files and perform validation of the L2 data.

For BIAS calibration required:
* L2 HF E spectra (plasma frequency line)
* L2 B field
* L2 plasma velocity
* L2 plasma density (particle instruments)
* L2 particle spectrograms

Here we require calibrated data from other instruments,
so for timely calibration it would be necessary to have
access to these data as soon as possible, e.g. before they
become public. This needs to be coordinated with other
in situ PIs.


Calibration files for E field DC/LF (up to 10kHZ)
-------------------------------------------------
Model the probe properties, and get the model transfer function
as a function of plasma parameters.

Verify the transfer function using known wave modes such as whistler
by comparing the E/B ratio and phase between E and B.


Spacecraft potential (time series)
----------------------------------
What we need is to understand which fraction of the spacecraft potential
we observe, as the probes are not exactly at the plasma potential.

Vps = K*Vps_observed

To know factor K will require in-flight calibration with electron
data (good resolution at low energies) and possibly simulations
with SPIS. As a result we expect to have a table with correction
factors corresponding to different levels of solar UV emissions,
bias current settings, etc.


E-field time series
-------------------
The goal is to get measurement of 2D electric field in the plane
of RPW probes (YZ plane). In-flight calibration is needed to get
the amplitude correction factor A and offsets dEy and dEz:

Ey = dEy + A*Ey_observed
Ez = dEz + A*Ez_observed

These correction factors are to be identified from comparison
of the observed E with -VxB observed by particle detectors
(ions and electrons) both for DC fields as well as for wave
fields for example for the Alfv√©n waves.

One expects that these factors will vary with distance from Sun,
bias settings and plasma paramaters, and how much these are going
to vary is difficult to predict. In the best case we will create
a model for the offsets using the solar UV flux, bias setting and
the spacecraft potential as input; otherwise, if it will not be
possible to create such a model, we will need to determine the correction
factors for every particular time interval.
