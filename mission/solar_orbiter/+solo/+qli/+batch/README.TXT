Package for batch generation of SolO quicklooks (in solo.qli).

The code is designed to generic in the sense that it can be reused for
any computer system. In practice, it is primarily intended for official
generation of quicklooks on a particular setup on a particular server at IRFU.

See irfu-matlab/mission/solar_orbiter/+solo/+qli/README.TXT for naming
conventions.
