Package for batch generation of SolO quicklooks (in solo.qli).

The code is designed to generic in the sense that it can be reused for
any system. In practice, it is primarily intended for official generation of
quicklooks.

See irfu-matlab/mission/solar_orbiter/+solo/+qli/README.TXT for naming
conventions.
