Code associated with using the particular setup and environment used for generating official IRFU quicklooks at IRFU (/data/solo/quicklooks/www/). The actual code should only contain thin wrappers which add very little additional functionality to the non-package code that is called. The code thus partly relies on particular hardcoded values associated with that setup, e.g. paths.

NOTE: This code should not be of interest to the typical user.
