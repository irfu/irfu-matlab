ADM = Automatic Dataset Management

Package for "management" of SolO datasets which follow official file naming
conventions. E.g. for
- identifying datasets among non-dataset files (based on filenaming)
- iterating over datasets
- finding datasets which overlap with a selected time interval
- identifying datasets with only the latest version
- identifying datasets of specific types (dataset ID)
- grouping datasets
etc.

NOTE: The code is used by e.g. BICAS proper and BICAS's batch processing tool
      (bicas.tools.batch).
NOTE: This code is managed by Erik P G Johansson. Backwards-incompatible changes
      may be made to it (though rarely)!
