ADM = Automatic Dataset Management

Package for "management" of SolO datasets that follow official file naming
conventions. E.g. for
- identifying datasets (based on filenaming)
- iterating over datasets
- finding datasets which overlap with selected time interval
- finding latest versions
- grouping datasets
etc.

NOTE: Code is used by e.g. BICAS proper and BICAS's batch processing tool
      (bicas.tools.batch).
NOTE: This code is managed by Erik P G Johansson. There may be
      backwards-incompatible change made to it (though rarely)!
