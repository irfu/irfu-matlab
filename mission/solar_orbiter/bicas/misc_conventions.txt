 Naming conventions
####################
The naming conventions are partly inconsistent for historical reasons.
The code should however converge on the following:
- Use the defined abbreviations in identifiers.
- Variables names: Should use camelCase/CamelCase.
    - Structs, instances of classes: Uppercase initial.
    - All other variables: Lowercase initial.
    - Exception: Variables which are direct analogues to zVariables are named
      as the corresponding zVariables, i.e. SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE most of
      the time.
- Classes (not instances of classes):
  - Classes which are actually instantiated (which are not merely a collection
    of static methods): Should be CamelCase. Initial in uppercase.
  - Classes which are not instantiated: Should have short names and use
    lowercase without underscore.
- Functions should be named using snake_case but with abbreviations in
  uppercase.
- Special types of variables:
    b    = Logical (boolean) values, often logical arrays used for logical
           indexing.
    i, j = Indices into arrays (linear indexing).
    L    = Singleton instance of class bicas.Logger.

Unit tests (classes) have suffix "___UTEST".

 Abbreviations, dictionary
###########################
NOTE: This list primarily applies to comments and identifiers in the source
code, including package names, but it may also be relevant for understanding
log messages and the names of settings. Most of the abbreviations are not
"official" and have been created specifically for BICAS. The list exists to
centralize all definitions in one place. This list is therefore very important
for understanding BICAS.
--
AA, aampere
    Antenna Ampere. Calibrated ampere at the antenna.
AAPT
    Antenna Ampere/TM
ACHG
    (BIAS diff) AC High Gain.
ACLG
    (BIAS diff) AC Low Gain.
ASID
    Class bicas.proc.L1L2.AntennaSignalId. See ASR.
ASR, Antenna Signal Representation.
    (1) A reference to a particular type of "physical antenna signal"
        (a "data channel") which BIAS-LFR/TDS is trying to measure, or
        NOTE: Class ASID represents such a reference.
    (2) a measurement of such.
    In reality, the terminology is:
    ASR         : Pointer to a specific physical antenna signal, e.g. V12_LF
                  (DC diff, antenna 1-2)
    ASR samples : Samples representing a specific ASR (as opposed to BLTS).
    NOTE: There are 9 ASRs (DC: 3 singles, 3 diffs; AC: 3 diffs), i.e. they
    can refer also to signals not represented by any single BLTS, given a
    chosen mux mode (BDM) and demultiplexer latching relay (DLR) setting.
AV, avolt, Antenna Volt
    Calibrated volt at the antennas, i.e. the final calibrated (measured)
    value, including for reconstructed signals (e.g. diffs calculated from
    singles). May also refer to offsets and values without offsets.
AVPIV
    Antenna Volt / (Per) Interface Volt
BDM, "mux mode"
    BIAS Demultiplexer Mode. Corresponds to BIAS HK ZV "HK_BIA_MODE_MUX_SET".
    Abbreviation partly just to have one consistent name (replacing "mux",
    "mux mode", "demux mode", "demultiplexer mode", "bias mux mode", etc.)
    and to distinguish it from "muxing" as a verb. Mostly used internally,
    not in the interface.
BFM
    BICAS Functionality Mode. One of the basic modes of BICAS operations:
    Print version, print identifiction, print help, or process
    datasets. Exactly one of these must apply every time BICAS is run.
BFMID
    String constant which uniquely represents a particular BFM.
BIAS specification
    Document RPW-SYS-MEB-BIA-SPC-00001-IRF, "RPW Instrument -- BIAS
    Specification".
BIAS_1, ..., BIAS_5 (BIAS_i, i=1..5)
    Defined in BIAS specifications document. Equal to the physical signal at
    the physical boundary between BIAS and LFR/TDS. Unit: Interface volt.
    Should be, and mostly is, replaced by BLTS+specified unit in
    the implementation.
BICAS
    BIAS Calibration Software
BLTS = BIAS-LFR/TDS SIGNAL
    Signals somewhere between the LFR/TDS ADCs and the non-antenna side of the
    BIAS demuxer including the BIAS transfer functions. Like BIAS_i, i=1..5,
    but includes various stages of calibration/non-calibration, including in
    particular
      - TM units (inside LFR/TDS),
      - Interface volt (at the physical boundary BIAS-LFR/TDS (BIAS_i)), and
      - Calibrated values inside BIAS but without demuxer addition and
        subtraction inside BIAS (i.e. including using BIAS offsets, BIAS
        transfer functions; volt).
    NOTE: This definition is partly created to avoid using term "BIAS_i" since
    it is easily confused with other things (the subsystem BIAS, bias currents),
    partly to include various stages of calibration.
BRVF
    BIAS RCT Validity File. Not ROC term. File "bias_rct_validity.json" as
    specified by ROC.
BSO
    Singleton instance of class bicas.Settings which stores the settings for
    BICAS as a whole.
CA
    Cell Array.
CLI
    Command-Line Interface. In particular, "CLI arguments" refers to an array of
    string arguments submitted to BICAS via the OS.
CLI option
      The combination of an option header and the immediately subsequent (and
      associated) option values.
      Ex: --version
      Ex: --file  /home/fleksnes/BICAS/conf/bicas.conf
      Ex: --setting varX 123
CLI option header
      A predefined (hard-coded, more or less, or many by e.g. reg.expr.)
      string meant to match a single argument. It does not have to begin with
      "--" or "-" though that is the convention.
      Ex: --verbose
      Ex: --setting
CLI option ID
      String constant. Represents the definition of an option and the
      corresponding results from parsing CLI arguments using that definition.
CLI option value(s)
      A sequence of arguments (could be zero arguments) following an option
      header with which they are associated. The number of expected option
      values should be predefined for the option.
      Ex: --version    # Zero option values
      Ex: --setting OPTION_VALUE_1 OPTION_VALUE_2
CM3
    cm^-3
COHB
    CLI Option Header Body. The section of an CLI argument option/flag which
    excludes the prefix, e.g. "-" or "--".
    See bicas.utils.cli.parse_CLI_options().
COPC
    Class bicas.utils.cli.OptionConfig.
COPV
    Class bicas.utils.cli.OptionValue.
CWF
    Continuous WaveForm. Data on the form of samples over longer periods of
    time than a snapshot. Cf. SWF.
Dataset (data set)
    A CDF file on any one of a number standardized formats specified by the
    various RPW teams. All CDF files in the context of BICAS are datasets,
    except for RCTs, where it is ambiguous.
Deg
    Degrees (angle). 1 revolution = 360 degrees = 2*pi radians.
DCIP
    Class bicas.proc.L1L2.DemultiplexingCalibrationInput.
DCOP
    Class bicas.proc.L1L2.DemultiplexingCalibrationOutput.
Dict
    MATLAB dictionary.
DLR
    Demultiplexer Latching Relay. Relay (true/false) that is part of the state
    of the demultiplexer.  See BIAS specification, section "3.4.4.14 MODE",
    "Data D3 = Diff probe 1&2(0), Diff probe 1&3(1)".
    Corresponds to BIAS HK zVariable "HK_BIA_MODE_DIFF_PROBE". The convention
    used for representing the value in BICAS is the same as in the BIAS HK ZV:
    0/false = V12
    1/true  = V13
    2023-08-29, EJ: Variable is constant for the entire mission except when it
    flips from zero to one at about 2023-08-21T12:04Z.
DRT
    Class bicas.tf.Deretrending.
DSI, "dataset ID"
    DATASET_ID or "dataset ID". String constant which uniquely identifies a
    type of dataset.
    NOTE: The concept of "dataset ID" is defined by RPW/ROC, but
    the abbreviation "DSI" is defined by BICAS. DSI does not formally exist in
    SolO outside RPW, though the SolO metadata standards define metadata and
    filenames with components ("source"+"level"+"descriptor") which together are
    identical to DSI for RPW datasets and can be used to define DSI analogously
    for SolO datasets outside RPW.
    NOTE: Must be uppercase by definition (at least when used as string
    constants by BICAS), though DSIs are represented in lowercase in the
    official dataset file naming convention (except the "level"). Uppercase DSI
    has been used in file names for some old ground-test datasets.
    NOTE: DSIs exclude the "-cdag" suffix. "-cdag" is defined by ROC
    for RPW-internal datasets only.
    NOTE: Variable names which refer to the GA "Dataset_ID" (and historical
    variants thereof) are not abbreviated "DSI", but to the GA name in
    analogy with other variables named after GAs.

    the saturation of the entire snapshot, or (2) saturation flags for CWF
    data which may take saturation before or after into account.
TTW
    TT2000 WOLS. Time format analogous to TT2000 but without leap seconds.
