Release notes
=============
Note: This list includes updates to unofficial functionality, e.g. for
processing L2 to L3.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
* Almost-complete support for LFR & TDS datasets (voltages) with transfer
  functions (partially tested). No parasitic capacitance.


Version 2.0.0
-------------
* Added support for L1 input bias current datasets; supports updated L1R input
  datasets, and updated L2 master CDFs (V08).


Version 2.0.1
-------------
* Bugfix: Reads bias current zVars as nA (not uA)


Version 3.0.0
-------------
* Functionality for ITF high freq. cutoff.
* Uses master CDFs V09 (instead of V08).
* Copies zVar BW from LFR datasets.
* Searches for BIAS RCT using other filenaming scheme: *RPW-BIAS*.
* L2 bias current in nA (not ampere).
* Uses LFR mux mode.


Version 3.1.0
-------------
* Bugfix to handle LFR L1 zVar BW=0.
* Preliminary sweep removal.
* Performance improvement (speed-up).
* Preliminary setting of zVar QUALITY_FLAG (max 2).
* Unofficial preliminary support for producing L2-->L3.


Version 3.1.1
-------------
* Modified default settings:
  (1) inverted transfer function cutoff at 0.8*omega_Nyquist (instead of 0.7)
  (2) duplicate bias current gives error (instead of using mitigation)


Version 4.0.0
-------------
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table for setting QUALITY_FLAG,
  L2_QUALITY_BITMASK (new)
* Set glob.attr. Datetime, OBS_ID, SOOP_TYPE, TIME_MIN, TIME_MAX
* Modified default setting:
  PROCESSING.L1R.LFR.ZV_QUALITY_FLAG_BITMASK_EMPTY_POLICY=ERROR


Version 4.1.0
-------------
* Added setting quality variables based on thruster firings in
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table. List complete until 2020-12-05.
* Zero order AC de-trending (remove mean, not linear fit), no AC re-trending
  (~bugfix; re-trending makes no sense for high-pass filtered data).
* Combined transfer functions (LFR+BIAS) for AC data are modified during
  execution to have constant gain for low freqs (prevents low frequency noise
  from being amplified.)
* Bugfix: glob.attr. Datetime, OBS_ID, SOOP_TYPE
* Bugfix: not crashing when reading CURRENT datasets with one bias setting.
* Note: Requires updated BIAS RCT to not crash.


Version 5.0.0
-------------
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table for thruster firings & saturation up until
  2021-01-26.
* Better output CDF standards compliance.
* Using new L2 master CDFs.


Version 6.0.0
-------------
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2021-09-11.
* Using new L2 master CDFs.
* Sets CDF zVariable attributes SCALEMIN & SCALEMAX using zVar min & max values.
* Disabled excessive log messages for processing L1/L1R-->L2 LFR SWF
  representing sequences of CDF records.
* Permits HK and science input datasets to not overlap at all in order to
  salvage some LFR DC data. Previously only allowed for partial datasets
  (otherwise error).


Version 6.0.1
-------------
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2022-09-03.
* Bugfix: Use LFR's R0/R1/R2 for splitting into time intervals. This bugfix
  should keep some LFR L2 data that was previously deleted.
* Addresses https://gitlab.obspm.fr/ROC/RCS/BICAS/-/issues/71 by not producing
  any .matlab_datastore_* file.


Version 6.0.2
-------------
* Bugfix: Corrected algorithm/formula for calculating Ez_SRF (vdccal.m).
* Recalculated and added E-field calibration data. Now covers 2020-02-28 to
  2022-12-03.
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2022-12-17.


Version 7.0.0
-------------
* Using new L2 master CDFs with corrections for DELTA_PLUS/MINUS_VAR,
  APPLICABLE, Data_type.
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2023-02-05.


Version 8.0.0
-------------
* Renamed settings:
      PROCESSING.L2-CWF-DWNS.ZV_QUALITY_FLAG_MIN
  --> PROCESSING.L2-CWF-DSR.ZV_QUALITY_FLAG_MIN
      SW_MODES.L2-L2_CWF-DWNS_ENABLED
  --> SWM.L2-L2_CWF-DSR_ENABLED
      SW_MODES.L1-L2_ENABLED
  --> SWM.L1-L2_ENABLED
      SW_MODES.L2-L2_CWF-DSR_ENABLED
  --> SWM.L2-L2_CWF-DSR_ENABLED
      SW_MODES.L2-L3_ENABLED
  --> SWM.L2-L3_ENABLED
      INPUT_CDF.GA_DATASET_ID_MISMATCH_POLICY
  --> INPUT_CDF.GA_DSI_MISMATCH_POLICY
* Change name of unofficial s/w mode (L2-->L3):
      LFR-SURV-CWF-E-DWNS
  --> LFR-SURV-CWF-E-DSR
* Enable glob. attr. "MODS".
* Read and use setting for demultiplexer latching relay in BIAS HK
  (HK_BIA_MODE_DIFF_PROBE).
* Use automatic saturation detection for setting full saturation bit in
  L2_QUALITY_BITMASK and for capping QUALITY_FLAG.
* Use measured BIAS HK currents for detecting sweeps for data beginning
  2023-12-16. Use mux mode for detecting sweeps before this date.
  Note: This should be a temporary measure until BICAS can detect sweeps
        via QUALITY_BITMASK (L1).
* Add zVariable L3_QUALITY_BITMASK to L3 density datasets and set quality bit
  for bad density quality in it.
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2024-01-11.
* Much refactoring (internal code reorganization).
--
NOTE: Generates datasets using CDF 3.7.1 as before. This file previously falsely
      stated that a later CDF format was used.


Version 8.0.1
-------------
* Corrected documentation w.r.t. the CDF format version used in BICAS v8.0.0.
  This version still uses CDF 3.7.1.
* Changed source code style: Two whitespace indentation, no trailing whitespace.
* QUALITY_FLAG is now capped at 3 (previously 2).
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2024-01-30.
* Bugfix: Automatic sweep detection (SCDA) no longer removes data due to
  labelling data as sweeps when constant BIAS HK currents are very different.
* Changed setting names relating to autodetection of sweeps.


Version 8.1.0
-------------
* Require and use MATLAB R2024a (instead of MATLAB R2019b).
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2024-05-05.


Version 8.2.0
-------------
* Uses zVariable compression used in master CDFs.
* Requires new L2 master CDFs V15, updated for compliance with archiving
  conventions in
  * SOL-SGS-TN-0009, 02/06, "Metadata Definition for Solar Orbiter Science Data"
  * ROC-PRO-PIP-ICD-00037-LES, 01/07, RCS ICD
  Some code updates associated with this:
  * Correctly(?) setting TIME_MIN/TIME_MAX.
  * Setting "SPICE_KERNELS", "CAL_*", "CALIBRATION_*".
  * Not setting "Provider", "Parent_version".
* Requires BIAS RCT on new filenaming convention, e.g.
  "solo_CAL_rpw-bias_20220210-20990101_V01.cdf", by changing the default
  value for setting PROCESSING.RCT_REGEXP.BIAS.
* Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table thruster firings updated for until
  2024-05-19, and previously missing thruster firing for 2024-04-11.
* Produces datasets using CDF version 3.9.0.
* Removed obsoleted settings:
  OUTPUT_CDF.GA_MODS_ENABLED
  OUTPUT_CDF.WRITE_FILE_DISABLED
  OUTPUT_CDF.NO_PROCESSING_EMPTY_FILE
  JSON_OBJECT_STR.INDENT_SIZE
* Renamed setting:
     INPUT_CDF.GA_PROVIDER_MISMATCH_POLICY
  -->INPUT_CDF.GA_PARENTS_MISMATCH_POLICY
* Abolishes the unofficial --swdescriptor argument.


Version 8.2.1
