%
% Return the value for the BIAS demultiplexer latching relay which, together
% with the demultiplexer mode, determines how BLTS channels and ASR signals are
% related.
%
% The latching relay state should ideally be obtained from telecommanding just
% like the bias currents, but this has not been implemented into the ROC
% pipeline and is not planned to be since the latching relay state is not
% expected to be changed unless a hardware failure (probe failure) occurs
% (2019-11-19). Therefore, the latching relay state is hard-coded until further
% notice.
%
% NOTE: BIAS HK contains the value in HK_BIA_MODE_DIFF_PROBE (presumably). See
% BIAS specification, section "3.4.4.14 MODE", "Data D3 = Diff probe 1&2(0),
% Diff probe 1&3(1)"
%
% 2023-07-28: YK has asked ROC/Diane Berard who has asked SOC to change the DLR
% value. "will likely take several weeks".
% Diane Berard e-mail 2023-08-29: The latching relay did change on "August 21st
% at 12:03:04 in flight". HK_BIA_MODE_DIFF_PROBE should indeed (very likely) be
% the latching relay.

% ARGUMENTS AND RETURN VALUE
% ==========================
% Epoch 
% dlrUsing12 : 0/1, false/true. Array same size as Epoch.
%               False=0 = Using diffs V13_DC, V13_AC
%               True =1 = Using diffs V12_DC, V12_AC
%               NOTE: The meaning of values follow the opposite convention
%               compared to BIAS specification.
