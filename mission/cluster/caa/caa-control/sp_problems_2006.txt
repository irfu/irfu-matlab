Problems seen when looking through the summary plots for 2006
=============================================================

1a) Processing bugs fixed
========================
2006-01-11 06: problems in the C2 Vsc data
   Consider changing to blank the saturated probe data from the L2/L3 products, rather than using the max.
   Will result in cleaner L3, but blanks in the L2.
   Maybe still use the max method for 4-probe data.
   Fix: use max of all available probes, not just the 2 in the active probe pair.

2006-02-01 06: summary plot generation failed with message MATLAB:pcolor:NonRealInputs. Data inputs must be real.
  - spectra generated and put into diESPEC2p1234 (/data/caa/l1/2006/20060201_0600/C2/20060201_0730) is complex.
  - fixed caa_powerfft.m

2006-01-09 00: C3 lacking spinfit data
  - wE3p32 has only 31 points vs. wE3p34 which has 134976 points
     - reason: switchover of HX sampling from V32L_V34L to V2L_V34L
  - in the dies processing, this causes the phase to be retrieved only for these 31 p32 points, but then used for the p34 points
  - removed assumption that (# p12/p32 points) = (# p34 points) from GetData.m

2006-01-09 00: C3 quality flags wrong after bugxfix. Most of interval should be marked as single probe pair (quality=1)
  Sets flag based on result of c_load('diE?p1234_info', cli, 'var'), which looks in EDSIf.mat
  diE?p1234_info is set during diespec/die/dief processing
  If blanking too much data from one probe pair (>50%), mark whole interval as single-probe
  (dirty, but affects extremely little data, and that data is bad anyway)

2006-01-13 12: Bad Vsc on C2. Other sats go bad soon after. see also 2006-01-11 09
  Changed hbiassa to flag intervals with ADC offsets consistently > 50 mV/m (at least 2 spins in a row)
  Then changed ps processing to use a max, rather than a mean, for hbiassa affected intervals

Want some way to mark problems by hand.
  New getData quantity "manproblems" sets problems based on datatbase at /data/cluster/caa-control.
  Added to the CaaRunner L1 quantities.

2006-01-03 03: why is C2 flagging saturation?
  Problem: large (>5 mV/m) strictly-sunward fields are being erroneously flagged as hbiassa.
  Put a new criterion on wide (>100 deg) wakes: must be really large fields (>50 mV/m).

2006-02-13 00:  C2 Ex offset from 0130 to 0300
  It's supposed to zero this at getData line 534, but it isn't. Creates a problem when generating sp/cef

07-18 12: C1 delta offset looks bad. Continues until about 07-19 1033. Started at 0721.
  Switching over too easily to p32. Made it harder in getData.

09-16 18- (09-17 12): Where's C2?
  badbias, but doesn't look that way to me...
  no efwt data, which means that the badbias threshold was set wrong.
  ISDAT returns end of file.
  Fixed in matlab software and reprocessed. Should maybe be fixed in ISDAT.

1b) Plotting bugs fixed
=======================
2006-01-01 00: jump in 2nd harmonic at 0130
   also:  2006-01-01 21, 01-02 00, 01-02 03,01-02 09, ...
   - using p32 data for earlier interval, due to selection
     based on hsbias flagging (GetData line 1745)
   - maybe add a label to the summary plot panel?

summary plots should remove hbiassa before plotting Ex, Ey
summary plots should remove whisper before plotting Ex, Ey
summary plots should remove probe saturation before plotting Ex, Ey

2006-01-03 09: why are the lobe wake circles only going on C4?
2006-01-03 12: why are the plasmasphere wake symbols not being plotted?

What does the L3 P data look like? Should switch the panel in the spec figure to L3.

abba has no pdfjoin utility, so the summary plots created there have not been joined as they should.
  Fixed.

How far apart are the spacecraft now?
  wrote caa_pl_separation. Quick and dirty.

remove ns_ops intervals from Exy data.

1c) Data problems fixed
=======================
2006-01-06 12: phase problem on C4 after maneuver

2006-01-13 06: What happened to the C4 spinfit data?
2006-01-26 15: What happened to the C3 spinfit data?
2006-01-30 03: What happened to the C4 data?
  Bad phase data. (All of the above)

2006-01-03 12: Missed the plasmasphere wake detection on C3.
  Not sure what happened here. Re-run fixed it.

2006-01-10 18: Missed the plasmasphere wake detection on C3.
  Small fields didn't exceed the error threshold of 1 mV/m.
  Set flag by hand.
2006-01-06 00: missed pswake on C3

2006-02-05 21: Missed pswake on C34
03-04 03: missed pswake on C3
03-13 15: partly missed pswake on C34

2006-02-05 09: why is the Ex plot limits so bad?
  Bad point in C2 data (should have been removed as probe saturation)

2006-02-12 12: what's going on with the gaps in the C4 spectra?
   Bad TM. Those packets are really missing. Flagged part of interval in ns_ops.

2006-02: C2 offset is too large by 0.1 mV/m

2006-02-09 09: only p12 is bad on C4. what does the L3 data look like? is it getting flagged?
  No, it's using the good probes and not flagging the data as hsbias. Good.

2006-02-12 15: Weird C4 Ex offset. Continues until lose data on 2006-02-13 0000.
  Strange-looking raw data with big difference p12 vs. p34.
  bad bias, strange problems with DSC data. Added to ns_ops and problems database.

03-08 0830 to 03-09 0130: where's the C3 data?
  Bad bias settings lead to probe saturation.
  Entered into ns_ops.

03-08 2100 to 0000: where's the C1 data?
  badbias. Entered into ns_ops.

03-19 0930-1505 where's C3?

04-30 03: missed pswake on C3. 0430-0650.

04-04 03: this doesn't look like pswake on C3 to me.
  removed in problems file.

04-04 06/9: outliers in Ex (C1/2 0820-0830, C2 0750-0800, C4 0930-0935, 1020-1030)
  should be marked hbiassa. fixed in problems file.

03-04 18: C2 needs another 0.2 mV/m of offset from 1930 to 2230.
  Looks like delta offsets are not very good for this interval, or indeed for all of 2006-03.
  Delta offsets were computed before changes to hbiassa processing.
  Re-did C2 delta offsets for 03-06 (inclusive).

  what's happening geophysically here? Interesting data.


2a) Software bugs to be fixed
=============================

2b) Data problems to be fixed/investigated
==========================================

3) Major data problems
======================
2006-01-06 06: C2 data is really bad. contaminated with some noise that looks somewhat like the 450 Hz noise, but at low frequency. Does this have to do with C2 using the 180 Hz filters??

2006-01-02 06: why is C3 Ey different?
  See also (among others): 2006-01-02 18, 2006-02-01 21
  2006-02-02 15/18 is interesting, since it starts out OK and then diverges as Ex gets larger.
  But this isn't always true (e.g. 2006-02-04 15, or 2006-01-26 03)
  C3 Ey is often a bit low (about 0.2 mV/m), but only when Ey is positive in the solar wind.
  C3 Ex is often then a bit high (about 0.2 mV/m)
  Overall, C3 Vsc is a bit higher than the other spacecraft, which is odd.
  It also seems a bit less prone to saturation (e.g. 2006-03-26). C2 is certainly most prone.

07-13 15 C3: maneuver at 16:25? Nope. What is this? (see also below)
07-30 09 C3: what's that at 0934? 1630? 07-31 0600? 07-31 09-12? 07-29 15? 07-28 22:10?
  ADC offset on p32 gets really large (15 mV/m, as opposed to 10 mV/m surrounding) for about 5 minutes.
  Happens during a dip in Vsc (density cavity).

4) Ignored problems
===================
2006-02-13 00: Why is C4 missing?
   The whole interval has badbias. Hence, there's no spinfitting done.

Should the plasmasphere wake detection algorithm be changed to look for spin harmonics?
  Currently examines deviation from corotation, and requires at least 1 mV/m.
  However, sometimes it misses (see above).
  May be easiest to just mark by eye when this happens.

2006-01-07 00: phase problems (?) at interval start on C3. Repeats at 0300 and 0730.
  No, just asymmetric data in the solar wind.

2006-02-08 18: Problems with Vsc L3 data

2006-02-04 09: why is there blanked Vsc on C3?
  Rendering problem in okular. evince correctly displays the pdf file with continuous Vsc on C3.

2006-02-13 00: C4 data missing. why? Continues until 02-14 00
  badbias.

2006-02-22 15: missing C3 data. continues until 1930
  saturated P3

04-24 00-07: C2 Ex is too high. again at 04-26 06. about 0.2 mV/m both times.

02-25 2230-0430: What's happening with C1 Vsc?
  This seems to be real. Maybe EDI is operating in a strange mode.


5) Unclassified
===============
ISDAT: why is the bias sometimes not returned correctly?
  e.g. 2006-06-18 C4: the bias was clearly changed to -40 nA at 0552, but ISDAT continues to show an OK bias until 0000.
  08-27 20:55- (28 0000) where's C3?
    badbias. probably is some data that could be rescued once ISDAT is fixed. Should also be noted in ns_ops.
  It looks to me like the ISDAT bias currents are largely just wrong with the new server.
  Example: compare bias changes for C3 2002-02-17 2200 between matlab (old ISDAT) and ISDAT (new ISDAT). :(
           must have occurred quite some time ago, since the "old" ISDAT server here on fernie is also broken.
  Index files were generated with an old ISDAT server and are not quite right. Need to be redone.

manproblems not properly implemented in the runners.



2006-09
*******

09-01 C3 0040: probe saturation in the auroral zone?
  Also 09-10 12 C34, 09-17 1540 C2
  probesa algorithm blanks anything near a negative probe voltage on any of the probes.
  Results in frequent NaNs in L2,L3 E data.
  Proposed solution:
   rename probesa from PROBE_SATURATION to NEGATIVE_PROBE_POTENTIAL
   rename probeld from LOW_DENSITY_SATURATION to PROBE_SATURATION
   move detection of latched probes from probesa to probeld in getData
   make sure Vp>50 goes inteo probesa
   Don't blank probesa from ec|dies|die
   Reprocess all data (all affected L1,L2 parameters) from 2006-09 onward that has any probesa set.

currently, probeld only when all 4 probes are at -68 for at least some time during the interval when a given probe goes below -68. Otherwise, it falls through to probesa if only some of the probes are below -68. So, for example, during the interval 2006-08-28T20:20Z to 21:00, C1 gets a probesa (not a probeld) flag because p1 doesn't go to -68V (since it's dead).

Need to reprocess E-field for any data with the new single-probe HBIASSA problems.
cd /home/chris/caa
caa_reproc('e_reproc_2006.txt','','ec|hbiassa|rawspec|dies|diespec|wake|manproblems|dief|die',[]);
(no need for manproblems when doing 2007)

  Need to decide on reprocessing other months (2006 01-06) as well.
   -> No, but do write it down on the Twiki.

2006
****
- what should be the write permissions for old directories (eg. 2001-2006?)?

2007
****
- may wish to modify caa_is_get near line 65, to try pause and try again if Mat_DbOpen fails
- need to determine sw offsets for late 2007

sp failure:
  Error encountered for 2007/20070119_1500:
  MATLAB:badsubscript
  Attempted to access result(4,1); index out of bounds because size(result)=[3,7].

2007-01-01: C3 offset needs to be increased by about 0.5 V.
   should be sh_interval, not ms_interval: all of 01-01, plus 01-02 until 1200

2007-01-03 1930-2040: what happened to C2?

2007-01-08 1500: C3 offset too small. Using sh offsets here in the sheath (correctly determined).
2007-01-09 0300: C3 offset too small by 0.3 mV/m even in sw (using sh offsets).
2007-01-13 0600: C3 offset too LARGE(!!) by 0.5 mV/m in sheath (using sh offsets).

2007-01-10 1732: bad packet, C3

NEED TO DO AN INIT_FAILED CHECK!!!
