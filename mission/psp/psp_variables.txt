Quality flags are on a 1 minute cadence, 
identifying intervals where instrument or spacecraft activities 
can affect the measurements.  0 signifies the absence of any flags. 

FIELDS quality flags. This is a bitwise variable, 
meaning that multiple flags can be set for a single time, 
by adding flag values. 

Current flagged values are: 
1: FIELDS antenna bias sweep, 
2: PSP thruster firing, 
4: SCM Calibration, 
8: PSP rotations for MAG calibration (MAG rolls), 
16: FIELDS MAG calibration sequence, 
32: SWEAP SPC in electron mode, 
64: PSP Solar limb sensor (SLS) test. 
128: PSP spacecraft is off umbra pointing. 

A value of zero corresponds to no set flags. 
Not all flags are relevant to all FIELDS data products, 
refer to notes in the CDF metadata and on the FIELDS SOC 
website for information on how the various flags impact 
FIELDS data. Additional flagged items may be added in the future.

Differential Energy Flux vs Energy/angle bin measured by the SPAN-Ae sensor, mounted on the ram side of the spacecraft.
The units are differential energy flux and eV.
The “sf1” product is an energy spectrum produced on the spacecraft by summing over the theta and phi directions. 
CAVEAT:The larger theta angles (deflection angles) are artificially enhanced in the “sf1” energy spectra data products 
due to the method of spectra production on the SPAN-E instrument (straight summing). 
Thus, SF1 energy spectra are not recommended for rigid statistical analysis.

Differential Energy Flux vs Energy/angle bin measured by the SPAN-B sensor, localized on the anti-ram side of the spacecraft.
The units are differential energy flux and eV.
The “sf1” product is an energy spectrum produced on the spacecraft by summing over the theta and phi directions. 
CAVEAT:The larger theta angles (deflection angles) are artificially enhanced in the “sf1” energy spectra data products 
due to the method of spectra production on the SPAN-E instrument (straight summing). 
Thus, SF1 energy spectra are not recommended for rigid statistical analysis.

proton bulk velocity from the 1st moment of the reduced distribution 
function in [inertial] RTN coordinate system.
.
For errors check rtnVpmom.userData.DELTA_(PLUS,MINUS)_VAR 
This moment is a model-independant estimate of the proton most-probable 
thermal speed, but it is subject to confusion with alpha particles when present. 
Error bars represent estimated upper and lower limits.

info#start
proton bulk velocity from the 1st moment of the reduced distribution 
function in SC coordinate system.
.
SC system is aligned with the Solar Probe Cup. 
In encounter orientations, the X-axis points in the spacecraft RAM direction, 
the Z-axis points [roughly] towards the sun, and the Y-axis points 
south relative to the solar ecliptic plane.
.     
This system is roughly, but not strictly aligned with the heliographic 
RTN system (R = -Z_SC, T = X_SC, N = -Y_SC) in encounters.
.
Note that this system is co-moving with the spacecraft. 
Flows from the sun appear aberrated and shifted in the spacecraft frame 
according to the instantaneous velocity of the spacecraft.

info#start
Array of SPC data quality indicators.
.
All flags are encoded as follows:
--------------------------
   = 0,   good/nominal/condition not present/etc 
   > 1,  bad/problematic/condition present/etc 
   = -1,  status not determined ("don't know")
   < -1,  status does not matter ("don't care")
.
-1 ("don't know") is the default value for all flags.
.
The 0th flag array element is the [standardized] global quality flag, 
signifying whether the data are suitable for use without caveate. 
It is repeated in the "general_flag" variable.

DQF has 32 columns where first 24 correspond to: 
% (0) general flag
% (1) primary peak low signal
% (2) no primary peak detected
% (3) cold primary peak or current spike detected
% (4) sensor saturated
% (5) primary peak not bound
% (6) poor Maxwellian fit to primary peak
% (7) flow direction poorly constrained or undetermined
% (8) alpha peak low signal/not identified
% (9) poor Maxwellian fit to alpha peak
% (10) alpha peak not bound
% (11) wind speed off scale high
% (12) wind speed off scale low
% (13) wind speed off scale unknown
% (14) likely proton-alpha confusion
% (15) unusually high noise levels detected
% (16) proton full-scan mode (not peak-tracking)
% (17) reduced data quality: anomalous periodic noise type A, (>1 Hz)
% (18) reduced data quality: anomalous periodic noise type B (< 1Hz)
% (19) temperature/survival heater cycling: potential fluctuations
% (20) reduced data quality: broadband or other anomalous noise (type C)
% (21) fragmented or incomplete spectrum measured
% (22) energy ranging/peak tracking error
% (23) spacecraft maneuver
.
Possible check - flags 1,2,4,5,6,7,11,12,13

Global quality flag, signifying whether the data for this epoch are 
suitable for use without caveats.
.
All flags are encoded as follows:
--------------------------
   = 0,   good/nominal/condition not present/etc 
   > 1,  bad/problematic/condition present/etc 
   = -1,  status not determined ("don't know")
   < -1,  status does not matter ("don't care")

-1 ("don't know") is the default value for all flags.

The user is advised to consider the quoted measurement uncertainties, 
particularly when the general quality flag is zero.
