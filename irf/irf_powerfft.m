%
% ARGUMENTS
% =========
%   data           - Either
%                     (1) a vector (first column is time in seconds; remaining
%                         columns are data), or
%                     (2) a TSeries object. May contain one sample per
%                         timestamp, or a 1D vector of samples per timestamp.
%                         Note: (2) is more likely to correctly handle leap
%                         seconds.
%   nFft           - Length of time covered by every spectrum, as measured by
%                    the number of samples when sampled at exactly sampling
%                    frequency samplFreqHz. This is also the number of samples
%                    (real or reconstructed) used for every spectrum.
%   samplFreqHz    - The sampling frequency [samples/s].
%   overlapPercent - Overlap between spectras in percent (0..100-).
%   smoothWidth    - (Unit: seconds?)
%
%
% RETURN VALUE(S)
% ===============
%	Specrec - Structure with below fields:
%		.t(iTime)
%          - Numeric column array. Time of each individual spectrum [seconds].
%            If "data" is a numeric matrix, then same time format as data time.
%            If "data" is a TSeries, then time format is epoch unix.
%		.p{iDataComp}(iTime, iFreq)
%          - Cell array of same-sized numeric 2D arrays of spectrum values.
%            NaN if too little underlying data for the particular spectrum.
%            iDataComp = Which data component out of multiple samples per
%            timestamp.
%		.f(iFreq)
%          - Numeric column array. Frequencies [Hz] for spectrum. One array
%            for all spectras.
%
%       Note: The structure can be passed to IRF_SPECTROGRAM with/without
%       modifications.
%       Note: IRF_SPECTROGRAM interprets .t as epoch unix, implying that if
%       "data" is a numeric array, then its time format must also be epoch unix.
%
%
% Note: If a sample=NaN is used for deriving a specific spectrum, then the
% entire spectrum is set to NaN.
%
% Note: Input data does not have to be sampled at samplFreqHz, and sampling
% frequency may vary over time. To derive spectra, shorter sequences of samples
% are sent to FFT. These sequences of samples are at exactly sampling frequency
% samplFreqHz, and are constructed from the submitted samples, by e.g. adjusting
% the timestamps.
% * When the actual sampling rate is HIGHER than samplFreqHz, then some samples
%   are dropped from (not used for) calculating the given spectrum.
% * When the actual sampling rate is LOWER than samplFreqHz, then missing
%   values are reconstructed by using the mean value. If the percentage of
%   missing samples for a given spectrum is over a set (hardcoded)
%   treeshold, then only NaN is used. ==> That entire spectrum is set to NaN.
%
%   WARNING: When the actual sampling rate is sufficiently much lower than
%   samplFreqHz, then there will be so many data gaps that all NaN is used for
%   all samples, rendering the affected spectras NaN, despite the presence of
%   valid data. To resolve this problem, the caller can
%   (1) split up the samples into sequences of approximately constant sampling
%       frequency and call IRF_POWERFFT (and optionally IRF_SPECTROGRAM) once
%       for each such sequence, or
%   (2) use the lowest sampling frequency in the data, sacrificing the
%       higher-frequency parts of the spectras.
