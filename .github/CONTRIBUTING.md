# Contributing to irfu-matlab

:+1::tada: Thank you kindly for taking the time to contribute, it is much appreciated! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to [irfu-matlab](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/), which is hosted on GitHub.com

These are mostly guidelines, in other words they are not rules or laws or government regulations (_myndighetsf√∂reskrifter_ in Swedish). Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.
If you are about to make any pull requests please request a merge to our [devel](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/tree/devel) branch, and in time these changes will propagate to our master branch when we are ready for a new release of irfu-matlab.

If working on a special development branch (e.g. [MMSdevel](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/tree/MMSdevel)), make sure to merge all the code from our latest [devel](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/tree/devel) branch on a semi-regular basis to help avoid merge conflicts if for some reason the code is changed in both branches.

## Coding style

1. According to [Matlab Style Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/web/20210424065750/http://www.datatool.com/downloads/matlab_style_guidelines.pdf "MATLAB Programming Style Guidelines")
2. Help follows matlab style, see [irf_template.m](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/blob/master/irf/irf_template.m)
3. Matlab code files checked for possible problems, using [checkcode](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/checkcode.html) (or [codeIssues](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/codeissues.html) if using a modern Matlab release).
4. For new code written, use only two spaces as indentation.

## Git

1. Workflow according to https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
2. Routines in [master](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/tree/master) branch should do not less and not more than written in their help!
3. Our [devel](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/tree/devel) branch includes latest delivered development changes for the next release.
4. Semantic release numbering https://semver.org/
5. Try to make use of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool to help check code before it is committed.
6. Write clear and useful git commit messages https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/


## pre-commit hooks

In order to help prevent simple misstakes from being committed in the first place a number of pre-commit checks (as specified in our [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml)) can be executed before each commit is actually made. In order for these checks to be executed please follow these steps on your local setup.

1. Install an instance of the program [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for your system, see [https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/).
2. Open a terminal in your local cloned folder of irfu-matlab then execute the command `pre-commit install`.
3. Now the pre-commit hooks should execute before each commit you are about to make and perform some simple checks on the state of the code.
4. If `pre-commit` reports that some checks fail, please check your code for corresponding misstakes.
