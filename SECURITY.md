# No explicit security policy for `irfu-matlab` alone.

Thanks for taking the time to have a look at our security policy. We strive to take your concern seriously.

However we do not currently have one security policy specific for only `irfu-matlab`, and we therefor recommend you instead have a look at the [security.txt](https://www.irfu.se/.well-known/security.txt). This `security.txt` file is defined as per [RFC 9116](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116.html).

Note: Our [IRFU.se security.txt](https://www.irfu.se/.well-known/security.txt) file is for IRF Uppsala (covering things like: `irfu.se`, `*.irfu.se`, `irfu-matlab`, etc.), however if you have found a security problem at our headquarters at IRF Kiruna (irf.se), then please have a look at their [IRF.se security.txt](https://www.irf.se/.well-known/security.txt) file instead.
